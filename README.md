# Description
CatyClient Version 1 Source Code !
# How to use
the client codes are in the main.txt, after modifying the main.txt launch the build.py and the CatyClient V1 code will be embedded in the tcpgecko.cpp then you open the cmd and you write "make" and then the elf will be made with the codes of CatyClient V1.
# Precision
I want to say that yes it's a ShineClient but don't judge it's only a start.. I'm new in this field and I think you would have done the same thing in my place but the CatyClient V2 will be done with only codes mine.
